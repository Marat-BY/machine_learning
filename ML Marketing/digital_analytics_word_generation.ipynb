    "The company (big furniture production plant) hired a digital agency to create a digital marketing campaign for the products being produced by them. The task is to create a large digital campaigns for all of their website. In this tutorial I will create a bunch of keywords for search campaigns for their products in sofa section. The clients needs is to generate keywords for the following products categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sofas\n",
    "* Convertible Sofas\n",
    "* Love seats\n",
    "* Recliners\n",
    "* Sofa Beds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The client is generally a low-cost retailer, offering many promotions and discounts. In this case the focus will be on keywords which are closely associated with such policy. Besides while working on this problem I also need to move away from luxury keywords and topics as the campaigns are targeting price-sensitive customers. Because the campaigns are tight on budget it would be good to focus on a tightly targeted set of keywords and make sure they are all set to exact and phrase match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the brief above firstly wll generate a list of words that together with the products given above would make for good keywords. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Products: sofas, recliners\n",
    "* Words: buy, price, prices\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting keywords: 'buy sofas', 'sofas buy', 'buy recliners', 'recliners buy', 'prices for furniture', 'sofas prices', 'prices recliners' and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the final result is nice to have a DataFrame that will be looking like this below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Campaign  | Ad Group  | Keyword    | Criterion Type |\n",

    "## Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Campaigns\n",
    "### What is SEM?\n",
    "SEM is one of the most effective ways to grow your business in an increasingly competitive marketplace. It is the process of gaining website traffic by purchasing ads on search engines. Google AdWords is one of the most popular forms of online advertising (you bid for ad placement in a search engine's sponsored links for keywords related to your business, then you pay to the search engine fee for each click or other type of action fee. It can be click, views and etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Paying per click in part of the situations is very expensive. And so it is very important to plan and group your keywords and ads in such way that you control you cost and have a profitable campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remeber: ** the more relevant your ads are the lower your cost per click **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up a Search Campaign.\n",
    "Before setting up a campaign you will typically come up with a budget, pick keywords and check out the competition. Also you will make sure that your landing page is in order. Then you can set up your campaign: you will write your first ad, fix it details and then set up conversion tracking. This work cover the process of generating a large number of keywords and ads, based on the different landing page you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ad Groups\n",
    "To get started with a search campaign you first need to develop a plan for your ad groups. This is the basic unit of organization where you map keywords, ads and landing pages. But what are these three components exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keywords: the user's intention, or otherwords what they are looking for?\n",
    "2. Ads: your promise to the user for that intention.\n",
    "3. Landing Pages: your delivery of the promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping those three elements properly is around 70% - 80% of the work process. If you get this right then maintenance and changes become much more easier. This means that, in order to be specific and relevant users, you need to promote the product you have and mainly focus on sending the right person to the right page, through the message or expectetion. A good campaign structure reflects and follows the structure of the website which is essentially reflecting the business strategy. Besides the fact, note that every ad group needs to be part of a campaign. At the campaign level, you have settings that govern all ad groups in the campaign such as language targeting, location targeting, devices, timezone and other valuable criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search Campaign, \"Baby-Steps\"\n",
    "We have looked at search campaigns at a very high level (keywords, ads and landing pages are part of an ad group) and you need to come up with a plan for this basic unit of organization where you map these three components in such a way that they reflect your business strategy. As an output it is preferrable to end up having two main DataFrames: 1) First one for keywords 2) Second one for ads. \n",
    "\n",
    "The table for the keywords are show upper in this section. The example of ads table will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Campaign  | Ad Group  |    URL       | Final URL          | Headline 1 | Headline 2  |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Campaign1 | AdGroup_1 | somesite.com | somesite.com/uar&a | Headline 1 | Headline 1a |\n",
    "| Campaign1 | AdGroup_2 | somesite.com | somesite.com/avd%& | Headline 1 | Headline 1a |\n",
    "| Campaign2 | AdGroup_1 | somesite.com | somesite.com/ac788 | Headline 2 | Headline 2a |\n",
